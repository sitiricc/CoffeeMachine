# CoffeeMachine

This program asks the user whether they want to purchase an espresso, a latte or a cappuccino. It then checks the reserves for each item's ingredients and decides whether the user is able to purchase the desired item.

The machine can also print out a report by typing 'report'.

Lastly, the machine can be turned off by entering 'off'.
